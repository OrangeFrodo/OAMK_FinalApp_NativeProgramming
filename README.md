# OAMK_FinalApp_NativeProgramming

My imagination left me, application is just a combination of yours lessons.
I wrote everything by my self. There is API call from https://yesno.wtf/ + Firebase authentication


I encountered these problems during development:
  1. API calls did nothing
  2. Authentication process did not write youser in my Firebase app
